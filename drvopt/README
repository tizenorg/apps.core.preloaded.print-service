how to use drvopt optimizer:

1) compile set of ppd files into one drv
   and on output we'll receive one .drv file(ppdi.drv):
   
	ppdc /home/i.mankaev/work/print-service/ppds/Hp/*

2) optimize received .drv file by drvopt:
	
	drvopt -i ppdi.drv -o stripped.drv


how to use getdrv extractor:

1) extract requred driver by model name:

	getdrv -i stripped.drv -r <modelname>
